        may make available. That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system,
        browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and
        immediately after leaving the Website. Such information is Personally identifiable information (PII), as it may
        be possible for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic
        location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes
        Personally identifiable information (PII) gathered from users of the Website to help Company better understand
